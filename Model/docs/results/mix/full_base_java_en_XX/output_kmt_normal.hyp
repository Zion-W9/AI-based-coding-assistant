main processing method for the aboutbox object
clamp the magnitude of value for absmin and absmax . if the value is below the minimum , it will be clamped to zero . if the value is above the maximum , it will be clamped to the maximum .
this method deals with the fact , that the decoding process doesn ' t always yield a single most likely value . the current error correction implementation doesn ' t deal with erasures very well , so it ' s better to provide a value for these ambiguous codewords instead of treating it as an erasure . the problem is that we don ' t know which of the ambiguous values to choose . we try decode using the first value , and if that fails , we use another of the ambiguous values and try to decode
